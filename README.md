# Project Description: Examining restaurant data to learn more about the variables affecting overall ratings.


### Level 2

#### Task1: Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- Compare the average ratings of restaurant with table booking and those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

#### Task 2: Analysis of Price Ranges
- Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
- Calculate the average rating for each price range.
- Identify the colour that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering:Â 
- Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

### Level 3: Predictive Modelling Tasks

#### Task #1: Predictive Modelling
- Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experiment with different algorithms (eg, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest) and compare their performance.


#### Task #2: Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
- Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.
- Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.

#### Task #3: Data Visualization
- Create Visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts.
- Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
- Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.
